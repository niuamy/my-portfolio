              <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
              <p>
                  I'm a rising sophomore at Ohio State University studying Computer Science and Engineering. 
                  For starters, although I'm an introvert, I love meeting new people and making connections! 
                  In my free time, I enjoy singing, listening to music and podcasts, and watching tv shows. 
                  My current favorite music artists include Lauv, Khalid, Noah Cyrus, and I've been a long- 
                  time shameless fan of Sam Smith. My most listened to podcasts include Modern Love and You 
                  Are Not So Smart. I spend a decent amount of time on Netflix as well watching just about 
                  any crime show, the Good Place, Money Heist, and most recently, I rewatched Avatar the 
                  Last Airbender. I also love bubble tea and worked at a bubble tea shop in high school, so 
                  if you need any recommendations, you know who to ask! :)

                  To preface, normally my favorite subjects to capture on camera are other human beings, 
                  specifically my friends and family. For privacy reasons however, I chose not to include 
                  actual photos of them.
