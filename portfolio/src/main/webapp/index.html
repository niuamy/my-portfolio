            <h1 id="about-me-header">Hi, I'm Amy</h1>
            <p id="about-me-description">I'm a rising sophomore at Ohio State University studying Computer Science and Engineering. 
                 For starters, although I'm an introvert, I love meeting new people and making connections! 
                 In my free time, I enjoy singing, listening to music and podcasts, and watching tv shows. 
                 My current favorite music artists include Lauv, Khalid, Noah Cyrus, and I've been a long- 
                 time shameless fan of Sam Smith. My most listened to podcasts include Modern Love and You 
                 Are Not So Smart. I spend a decent amount of time on Netflix as well watching just about 
                 any crime show, the Good Place, Money Heist, and most recently, I rewatched Avatar the 
                 Last Airbender. I also love bubble tea and worked at a bubble tea shop in high school, so 
                 if you need any recommendations, you know who to ask! :)

            <h2>Tag Cloud Generator</h2>
            <p>This was one of my favorite class projects. The objective was to use standard Java to read in a file 
                and output a tag cloud using HTML/CSS, where the size of each word was dependent on the amount of times
                it appeared in the file
            </p>
            <h2>GPA Calculator</h2>
            <p>This calculator has a dual purpose. One is to allow the user to input their courses and current letter grades
                to calculate their cumulative GPA. Another feature lets the user calculate their current grade for a given
                course.
            </p>
            <h2>MySite</h2>
            <p>This is one of my first attempts at a personal website from scratch. It mainly served as a practice project
                for the purpose or learning Python and HTML/CSS in Flask.
